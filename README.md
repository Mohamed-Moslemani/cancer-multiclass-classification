## üå† Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to the task of multiclass cancer classification using state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision and machine learning. The project primarily utilizes **transfer learning** to leverage pre-trained models and **few-shot learning** methods to achieve accurate classifications with limited data. This approach is especially useful in the medical domain, where annotated data can be scarce.
